## Hello there, fellow reader. 

4developers was overly great. I've been on some very cool conferences and I've met 
great people from [devspl Slack](https://devspl.slack.com/). I'll summarize every 
lecture worth mentioning and will end this post with my overall feelings about 
the whole event. 

### [Elixir of love by Jakub Gutkowski](http://2017.4developers.org.pl/en/program/lectures/elixir-milosci/)

One of my favorite lecture in the whole event. Jakub described basics of Elixir very 
well and made me very interested in that language, I seriously consider it to be 
my next to-learn language after Elm. There was also few words about Erlang (yet
another language that is very interesting to me) and how well designed it is compared
to almost any other solution on the market. Another thing I liked was humor of the
whole lecture - it was light and cheerful. 

### [5 architectures of asynchronous JavaScript by Tomasz Ducin](http://2017.4developers.org.pl/en/program/lectures/5-architectures-asynchronous-javascript/)

Lecture by Tomasz described every way to perform asynchronous actions in JavaScript. 
It wasn't bad but too basic for 2/3 of its length for me. People who are new with 
JavaScript and even concept of asynchronous and synchronous programming would find 
this lecture more interesting than me. 

### [Browsers behind your back by Phil Nash](http://2017.4developers.org.pl/en/program/lectures/browsers-behind-your-back/)

Web browsers can do really interesting things nowadays. Phil showed us just a few
of things you are able to do using native Chrome API. In his major example, he created 
service for sending SMS messages as a gateway that will work even if you try to send 
while being offline and coming back online after a while. With no additional interaction 
needed. It was really cool to see how browser took care and performed logic that 
sent data after the certain condition was met. 

### [Architecture antipatterns and how to beat them by Łukasz Szydło](http://2017.4developers.org.pl/en/program/lectures/architecture-antipatterns-and-how-beat-them/)

Sadly I was only on part II of Łukasz presentation but it still gave me some really 
meaningful concepts. Every bad concept (or rather its symptom) was presented as 
illness in really creative way alongside with causes and possible ways to fix it. 
Luckily for me, part II was about breaking monolith in a way that doesn't make it
very hard to test and maintain which was most interesting for me. It took very common 
pattern and "rotated" it making connection point in place that holds all interfaces 
and making it being dependency for all modules. 

I also attened talk about neural networks in TensorFlow by Krzysztof Sopyła but 
I won't summarize it yet before I try concepts he showed on my own. 

Overall I'm very happy with event and possibility to meet people I only knew from 
the internet it created. The only thing that was bad and many people will agree
with me was launch, it was kind of cheap stew in a stinky plastic tray.
