Hello there, fellow reader. 

Atom is currently "default" editor when it comes to developing for web or any JS 
related technology. Node, Electron, React Native, you name it. Facebook officially 
creates platform to build web and mobile apps as Atom plugin - 
[Nuclide](https://nuclide.io/).

## Why I don't like Atom

It's so slow and unstable I can't stand it. Don't get me wrong, I love its
flexibility and ability to easily change appearance and behavior. But I can't
work with an editor that tends to crash with little to no message or its tendency 
to give coffee break if I accidentally click on some minimized CSS/JS on my file
tree. 

## What cool kids editor I use

My editor of choice is *Visual Studio Code*. I use it to code everything from 
simple scripts, configs to all my applications. I even use it to write this post.
It's so reliable and fast compared to Atom you won't look back. And fact that it 
uses the same framework ([Electron](https://electron.atom.io/) - created... for 
Atom) gives Atom the final blow.

I'm sure you'll try to defend Atom by saying it has more useful plugins. It's only 
partially true. While a few months back Visual Studio Code would have only few useful 
ones now it gives you everything you'd ever need. 

Surely it doesn't have power mode but I'll show you some cool things it can do.

## What Visual Studio Code can do

### Great git support out of the box

You can easily view what branch you are on, push, pull, rebase and commit. Built-in
list of edited files gives the ability to stage, clean or preview changes to file 
you've just done before commiting them upstream. Very useful feature, prevents you 
from making stupid mistakes.

### Built-in debugger 

There's a debugger that has ready to use configuration for Node, Python, Chrome 
Dev Tools, React Native. It's pretty nice to be able to use a single tool for debugging 
across different platforms. 

### Minimap 

Loved by everyone I've met - minimap. It's a well known Sublime feature that found
it way to all sort of different editors. In Visual Studio Code it's build in from 
version 1.10. And it allows rendering characters or just colorful bars representing 
lines if you'd like to. Pretty cool.

### Support for various languages and linters

I have yet to find language that is not supported by some plugin in Visual Studio 
Code. So far everything I wanted to write in had some support. Usually it worked 
better than it used to in Atom. Plugins never caused problems for me and never 
displayed a big red crash message in the corner. 

### Configuration 

While Atom configuration is somewhat easier with tabs and windows it gives you
much fewer options. Visual Studio Code has a JSON based config with the search bar 
and quick change for any option. The right side is your settings, the left side is editor 
defaults. It seems to be harder to find anything but after playing with it around 
for couple of minutes you won't have any problems.
