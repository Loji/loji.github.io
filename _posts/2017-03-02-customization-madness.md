Hello there, fellow reader. 

You most likely wonder why I put so radically different statements next to each other. 
Let me explain. *I really love customization*. Everyone does after they feel comfortable
working in an environment they are working in. Customization is good and can greatly 
benefit our work. It can make us feel unique about ourselves. 

You may ask: 

>Why do you use basic black on white template for your blog? 

>Why won't you use some cool custom domain?

>Why won't you use some fancy X?

*Customization is a huge time drain*. Personally, I can spend hours and hours tweaking 
every single tool I'm using. It's really tiring to start working on the 15-minutes task 
and waste few hours after you find some cool extension that helps you save few minutes
of typing. Writing an extensible script for formatting some 50-line CSV document?
Hook me up, it's not like I have work to do. This blog would suffer the same fate 
if I'd start tweaking it. It wouldn't even be online since style would need some 
little changes, I would debate with myself over what domain I should use and so on. 
There is a lot of things that can be done better. 

And the worst part is that *act of improving your tool* was much 
more *entertaining* than doing that repetitive and boring task. Anything that occupies 
your mind and allows to do something creative is. 

I fight with this by using tools that have the basic functionality I need for work. 
Not IDE, not barebones editors with nice plugin API. If I'm improving something
at work I do so with timer, very strict rules and awareness of the plan for the day. 
So far it works quite well, fighting with customization addiction is successful.

I find my view on customization insanity a bit ironic given I create a tool to 
help you customize your environment. What do you think about customization, dear 
reader?
