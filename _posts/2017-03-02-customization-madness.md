Hello there, fellow reader. 

You most likely wonder why I put so radically different statements next to each other. 
Let me explain. I really love customization. Everyone does after they feel comfortable
working in an environment they are working in. Customization is good and can greatly 
benefit our work. It can make us feel unique about ourselves. 

But it also can be a huge time drain. Personally, I can spend hours and hours tweaking 
every single tool I'm using. It's really tiring to start working on the 15-minutes task 
and waste few hours after you find some cool extension that helps you save few minutes
of typing. And the worst part is that act of tweaking and improving your tool was much 
more entertaining than doing that repetitive and boring task. 

I fight with this by using tools that have the basic functionality I need for work. 
Not IDE, not barebones editors with nice plugin API. If I'm improving something
at work I do so with timer and very strict rules. So far it works quite well,
fighting with customization addiction is successful.

I find my view on customization insanity a bit ironic given I create a tool to 
help you customize your environment. What do you think about customization, dear 
reader?
